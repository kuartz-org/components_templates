The design system is a collection of reusable components.

## Update
In order to update the design system, you need to clone the design system repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kuartz-org/components_templates.git
```

Then you can run the following command to update the design system from your application directory.

```bash
cd ../components_templates
git pull origin master
cd ../your_app
rails app:template LOCATION=../components_templates/template.rb
```

! Make sure you have committed all your changes before running the command since
it will override the viewComponents directory.
